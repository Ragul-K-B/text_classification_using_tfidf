"Ignorance of immature children ,If you don't laugh at the king, then what? Ghani is our pride, Ghani is our leader, Ghani is the mourner of our country",1
I like it but I don't know anymore,1
"Ghani is a leader for himself and not for the people of the country
  what is going on?
  Now most of the citizens are selling their bodies",-1
what happened with you. This is not joking that you do,-1
Long live Dr. Ashraf Ghani,1
The best guarantee is death,-1
Life Life Beloved President Ghani Baba All nations stand by their system,1
This guarantee was taken before the release of the Taliban,-1

How do agreements make more agreements but we have watered the blood of Afghans like water,-1
reality ,1
Let the whole of Afghanistan shine,1
I am amazed at Ghani's ignorance and slavery,-1
"when will start work on Kunar's Dam , President sir",1
It's ridiculous.,-1
you face is very bad,-1
The same guarantee was given to Dr. Najib,1
"I love Baba jana, we like you more than whole world , live long",1
"Thank you President, it is about the development work that has finally won the hearts of Afghans.",1
It's reality ,1

big foolish ,-1
Long live Ghani Baba,1
What are our Pashtun hackers doing? Hicking our sister's accounts and Their personalities have been captured and warnings have been issued. Her sister's respect has been auctioned off in the media.,-1
Tell me how much fun it will be,-1
Cursed be your father,-1
Our hackers are no less than anyone. ,1
It would be very interesting.,-1
"I think, that the Trump has died ",-1
Just wait for one of your sweet games,1
We will wait for the most fresh fire,-1
"Means that, it will not build .",-1
"This airport should not be built in Logar because then the weather in Pakistan will get worse! That will greatly reduce the yield of pulses! In the near future, a fatwa will be issued by the Punjabi Mullahs !!!",-1
"It is a waste of money to build power dams and
  He has built a specialized hospital
  We are in dire need of power outages from the airport to well-equipped hospitals",-1
"Nonsense ,  fuck Your mothers, Anairfield in 15 years ?
  God destroy  on such govern,
  In 15 years of education, people build a country, You're airport, curse ",-1
"Dear Logar, all of them are Taban. The Logaris are the first to remove this animal from their province and rebuild it. There are exceptions.",1
"fuck Talib
I am also from Logar. We have sacrificed Azra. Commando National Army Front Police. Amanat Milli. We have also participated in other incidents. We also have the right.",-1
"The airport, which was mapped out at the time of Dawat Khan, has been replaced by the  International Airport.Now, if it is built, it will bring more revenue to Afghanistan",1
"There is no need because Logar and Kabul are half an hour's drive away
  The money is used to build a dam to supply water to the farmer till the end of the field.",-1
"Well, the dream world has skyrocketed in so much time
   And we will make an airport, but it is good
  The year is 2035 Mashaallah, will can't make it past",-1
"Instead of sitting down with bad friends, loneless is better

"Cats will not be fed at home
  Will advise the president on Facebook",1
"I beat them on the fields
What did we do with it، To me, the blood of an Afghan, life and then progress is important",-1
"OK but what does that mean?
  Logar, however, is close to Kabul
    Kabul Airport needs to be bigger and smarter.",-1
But now I have heard that an airport will be built in 15 years. It is a rediculas  country.,-1
"I think it will not be 2035 but 2025. But I am in favor of any kind of population development and progress in every corner of our homeland Afghanistan, because every point. My dear homeland is Afghanistan, thank you (Maiwand).",1
"Great, indeed Logar is a great location for the rainforest, and a great economic opportunity for the people of Logar.",1
This is a very good deed. Every country in the country needs reconstruction and development.,1
"The money should be spent at the Kabul airport. If the people of Logar want an airport, they must first revolt against the terrorists who have spread terror all over Afghanistan.",-1
"When the airport is built in Logar, know that the old Afghanistan has started again",1
"doing very hurry , 2050 was a good year",-1
We also want to build an airport in Batikot district,1
Dr. Najibullah International Airport in the name of miscreants do not want everyone to know,-1
2035. The year is not far away ... at this time a country will be formed,-1
"Congratulations again, dear ones, this day will probably be a God willing one",1
We also build international airports every eighty or one hundred kilometers. There are two or three international flights a week. I think it would have been better if the existing airfields had been fortified first so that we would not have suffered losses and then we would have built more.,-1
"In the year 2050, in the school, asked a question from students about which country has the highest number of people, living in airports, and the genius students will write , Afghanistan is covered with mountains and airfields.",-1
"Good news, but here it is said that it will be completed in 15 years. Assume that it will be completed in 2050 or not. Because the completion date of each project is shown as two years, it would have not completed in five years",-1
The choice is good but the time has shown more. Logar is a good place,1
"You butld it. We will congratulate you. Orientals will build a 40-meter road to China. Another settlement is a historic one. Afghanistan is the heart of the whole world having clear atmosphere ,  tuorist will come here.",1
All that needs to be done is to build a dam on the Kunar River with this money so that the entire nation can pray that the aspiration of the entire nation,1
"They don’t do basic work
  Imported electricity has its own benefits، Dams are basic but they never want to build dams",-1
"Mashaallah. God willing. If the people of Afghanistan are smart, they should cooperate in the implementation of such national projects.The people and government of Afghanistan must also work to extract copper glasses and other minerals",1
The eastern zone has great economic value but does not have an international airport but that is fair.,-1
It would be better to work on other projects instead of smuggling for dollars and other such things.,-1
"Good news, and good news, for Afghanistan to move forward.",1
"It's been a long time since I've heard the good news.These days, there are so many happy news and such news is so much more.",1
The country's economy has a huge role to play,1
"There are so many airports that there is no profit to be made from them. Instead, we have to raise the level of education on the same money so that our future is bright.",1
"This is very interesting news .. Alas, if there is peace, then the construction of this airport will take 3 years from 15 years ..",1
"The news is that the airport in Paktia has been auctioned. Hahaha, the leaders of Paktia are also busy visiting their province day and night.
The Mitchell Dam was built, the Dalji Dam was built, so much electricity",-1
"In 15 years, the whole of Afghanistan must be built, but the excuse is to make money",-1
Terrorist Pakistan and its slaves who are shouting for an interim government will now be burnt,-1
"Italy, which had completed the field, is now announcing a demonstration for its military presence in the country.
Right now, all the equipment in the field is in the hands of thieves. All the equipment is smuggled out by night",-1
"Of course, Kabul airport needs to be upgraded, and Nangarhar needs to be rescheduled for public flights.",1
Greater Logar is the best place for an airport and the Miss Aynak mine is also there to be built.,1
"Although it is made up of ten workers, it takes 15 years",-1
It seems that other people will also go to Logar by plane ...,1
The construction of this airport also looks like going to Mars,-1
"At the moment we don't need airfields as much as we do education, peace, electricity, gas and water.",1
The journey from Kabul to Herat is 3 hours by car. The journey from Kabul to Herat is 3 hours by car. You can see the road from Kabul to Herat.Logar Maidan is necessary if Kabul-Herat road..kids play starts,-1
"Good news, we will wait for this, it will be beneficial for future Insha Allah, and this is beneficial forever for Afhganistan. May Allah make it good",1
"The good news is that God willing, the date of construction is long",1
"It's a two-mile drive, spending dollars on the other side of the country. If it is said to be a millennial homeland then it is true ....",-1
"if this would buit , we will get older, 14 year is very long duration, but it is still good new to hear that Lagar is developing , should be mad, good news",1
Ghani also brought proper provincialism. I think it would have been better if Kunar Dam had been built instead.,1
"the whole will be built but here is no one to serve for Paktia, the people of Paktia is destroyed ",-1
"This is ridiculous talk, but why not repair the roads?Kabul Herat Kabul Khost Kabul Shrine that will benefit all Afghans",-1
Logarian  chase; may God make it happen as soon as possible so that we too can go their .,1
"first fuck the Talib . Once Logar is cleansed of the Taliban, everything will be fine",-1
it will be like the road of Torkham and Jalal Abad,-1
"The move is good, but how can an airport run without electricity? Our people still uses solar their homes in Kabul . They are now beating Turkey and China.",1
"For God's sake. Build Kabul-Kandahar road. Don't look for airfields.
No shame, no shame, no pride, no eyebrows.",-1
"Good but, there is still dout that it will be built or not in 2035.  ",-1
May Allah this airport would be good for the development of Afghanistan,1
Don't be in a hurry. The hurry is the step of devil .,-1
May Allah make it soon,1
Kandahar airport to be built in the dust and Logar to become an international airport? This is very interesting.,1
Afghanistan is on the verge of collapse. They are thinking long and hard.,-1
"We want the good news of prosperity everywhere, one Afghanistan!",1
God bless you,1
the work on this is very fast so be slow ,-1
"airport in Lugar, great",1
"good, but it should be in big cities like Nangarhar, Mazar-e-Sharif, Herat, Kandahar, Helmand.",1
Ridiculous,-1
"Absolute Dam is very necessary, there is no need for a field",-1
Our grandchildren will travel in it again ? But it's good,1
What did you do in other provinces? And now you are moving to Logar,-1
"so hurry, in 2035 we wil have died .",-1
Every president of afghanistan serverd his own province not the whole nation.,-1
"The plan for the construction of the airport in Dawood Khan's republic was also funded by Saudi Arabia, but now it is time to take action under Ashraf Ghani. Good action ",1
very good step,1
Very good towards develop country,1
"If any project is implemented in any part of the country, it will benefit the entire nation",1
"This is good news, but it's not the least bit of a time, at least a hundred years is good.",-1
The airport was planned during the reign of Dawood Khan.,1
"We want the good news of prosperity everywhere, one Afghanistan!",1
Congratulation to the people of Logar,1
"In 2035, come on . I will make it in 4 years. Well, if you don't have money, I don't care. I'll wait for you.",-1
"Afghans need beating, they want everything in one day, one says they want to airport, another says they need education, you are just as good as humilated.",1
Brotherly foreign countries never want Afghanistan to have development.,-1
This country must be built,1
"I wish you knew the value of a good thinker like you, this dishonorable government",-1
"Well, congratulations to our, but they have given so much duration .",1
"The population should be able to build in each province, Move toward development ",1
He should be named  General Hashim Khan Logari,1
"Shaheed Daud Khan was a project of the time, which is now being discussed.",-1
So much time given,1
"It is a matter of not working, God knows, what will happen  in 35 years",-1
"in 14 years, a new state has been built in this duration",-1
"It is very good step, Logar is best place for it",1
"no need to it, already in Kabul, Khust and Kanadahar",-1
"God destroys their house, Kabul, and logar half an hour of traffic",-1
"ridiculous ,There is no airport in the world that is as ugly and useless as Khust airport.",-1
"fuck airport, 
  Build Kabul-Kandahar road",-1
"It is very good step, ",1
"Instead, this is 1 mile away distance, instead building a dam on the Kabul River",-1
There is no need to worry so much,-1
"the airport will be buitl but what about of airplanes , will the donky in it",-1
"Insha'Allah, it will be completed till 2085",-1
Then there will be resurrection and the reckoning will be over. Ruduce the duration ,-1
Wide and limited thinking is different!,1
Based on what need is this airport being built in Logar?,-1
Ridiculous,-1
Shame on you for building an airport in 15 years,-1
Praise be to Allaah. This is good news for a few days,1
The cow of the corrupt and the thief became birth again,-1
dam is neccessory,1
This map was approved during the time of the late Shaheed Daud Khan. This time is very long 15 years,-1
"You are joking , get lost",-1
What is the difference between Kabul and Logar? Very short .,1
We would be dead,-1
"Very good work has been done towards the population of the country
   The fuckers of madrassas in Pakistan will burn down, God willing",1
God will make it very soon. I would say 2100 would be good for completion date,-1
Good news but so long almost?,1
"by the way they want the  attention of people. Why didn't you build it 20 years ago, no matter how small Kabul Airport is?
  He now wants to rally the people
Now the baby's time is up",-1
It took a lot of time,-1
there is much airports than aeroplanes in Afghnistan,-1
"Don't spend too much on it
  it must be spent on Dams ",1
I don't think it's going to be easy,-1
Everyone has their homeland Kashmir. Ashraf Ghani has finally worked hard for his hometown,-1
"Mashaallah, Congratulation to every repectful person of Logar",1
"2035, means not possible, not expected",-1
we would be dead in 2035,-1
He has built dams on this money to divert the water of our country from these new countries and to buy electricity from some of them which would not be able to meet the needs of others.,-1
I don't expect.terrorism will continou till the finis of Punjab rigme ,-1
Toward the developed  Afghanistan,1

There are mullahs in Logar who say that the Mujahideen are ready to fly from the sky.,-1
"The blood of an Afghan is important to me, the life and the progress of the future. Fuck the airports",-1

The cow of miscreants and thieves became lame again,-1
"This is very interesting news .. Alas, if there is peace, then the construction of this airport will take 3 years from 15 years ..",1
It was also a commercial advertisement of the Ghani government,-1
A power dam from Logar airport and Daikundi airport is necessary.,-1
"You can be a man, just stay up all night in the red",1
Dams The most important thing is that Afghans want water and power dams for 1000 years,1
Whether Gul Ghani will live up to 7 years or not is a mockery of the people. How much money will the airport in Lebanon draw?,-1

"First remove the corrupt and illegitimate sperm of Hiramandi (Talib) from Logar, then everything is possible.",-1
"These are rediculas. He also started Ariana flights from Nangarhar airport. There is no need for an airport in Logar.

"Why don't Shahid Afridi and other players come to Afghanistan because it is a shame for the shameless cricket board and the real Afghans !! ""If any player leaves, he will not be able to remain loyal to the Afghan team.""",-1

The PSL will be more colorful this time around because our stars are at home,1
"May Allah Almighty keep you high
    That's a good thing",1
He has done a lot of bad things in the Pakistan League. Every Afghan who plays will be the biggest traitor. I will no longer be a supporter of Nabi Issa Khel.,-1
